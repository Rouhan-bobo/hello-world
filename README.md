# hello-world
just learn how to create a new repository guided by the tutorial.


I'll add sth to make it clearly show the changes.

I found that the first time when I touched with github is in my senior year.

Now I am working as an assistant in a factory office.I often feel upset 'cause I realised that there is no chance to learn sth useful, to earn a good salary or even to be happy in my present situation. I just wanna get back to my professional field--software engineering.It's very hard, but I have to try it.

What I have said seems too wordy,just for records.
